Description: A library of Raman spectra of mircroplastic particles.
    Spectra are available for 11 different polymers. Each comes along with a bunch of
    spectra for freshwater and sea water incubated particles. Those have created the
    so-called plastisphere. A surrounding layer of microorganism-born biomolecules like,
    for example, carrotinoids. The data can be accessed directly (provided through this package),
    or via the provided shiny app. The app provides easy and interactive access and
    vizualisation of the Raman spectres of 'RaMPP'. Additionally, this app allows the
    comparison of the available spectra and also with a user input spectrum. Upon mouse hovering 
    on the provided graphs, it will further show which components underly the current positions'
    spectrum and wether this is a typical peak for a certain polymer.
